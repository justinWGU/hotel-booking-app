# Hotel Booking App
Academic project consisiting of a full stack web app developed with a Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend to create a hotel booking app. I am only sharing some snippets of work due to academic integrity.

## Contribution
- My task was to add multi-threading capabilities to display a welcome message in two different languages, as well as dockerize the web app. I developed the necessary controllers using Spring Boot to generate instances of threads and create a Rest API for the frontend. I then created a component to consume the API and display the messages.
